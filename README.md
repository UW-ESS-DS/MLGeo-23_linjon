# MLGeo-23_linjon 

##Welcome
Jonathan Lindenmann's MLGeo2023 repository. This repository is stored in the [UW-ESS-DS GitHub](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-2023) organization.

This repo will be the foundation for the computational side of my future science projects, possibly exploring such things as: 

- Types of nephrite microstructures
- Formation mechanisms for different nephrites
- Impact assessments for un(der)regulated mining projects
- ML-assisted mineral exploration
- lots more


##Getting started
To access and work on any of my projects, clone this repository:



## Installation/Deployment

## Basic Usage: step-by-step instructions to use the software

This section covers coding commands and techniques from MLGeo2023 classes.
