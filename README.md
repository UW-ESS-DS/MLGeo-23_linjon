# MLGeo-23_linjon 

##Welcome
Jonathan Lindenmann's MLGeo2023 repository. 

This repo will be the foundation for the computational side of my future science projects, possibly exploring such things as: 

- Types of nephrite microstructures
- Formation mechanisms for different nephrites
- Impact assessments for un(der)regulated mining projects
- ML-assisted mineral exploration
- lots more


##Getting started
This repository is stored in the [UW-ESS-DS GitHub](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS) organization and contains a copy of `environment.yml` from the class repository [UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-2023](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-2023)

To access and work on any of my projects, you can clone my repository by typing the following into the CLI command line:

`git clone https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-23_linjon`


Use Pull requests to allow others to suggest code changes to a repos. The pull request tracks line-by-line changes and allow the repository contributors. Here is the workflow: - Create a fork of the repository - Clone the fork to the local computer - When done, add+commit+push from local to remote repository. The fork has the new changes. - Pull request from the browser original repository. Make sure that you mention specific colleagues to analyze your submission (use @their-github-name) to notify them. - look at the diff between the two repository. - the repository contributors/owners will accept or suggest additional modification before accepting. - Once accepted, your changes will be part of the main repository.


## Installation/Deployment

## Basic Usage: step-by-step instructions to use the software

This section covers coding commands and techniques from MLGeo2023 classes. 

For the command line interface (CLI):

mkdir xxx - makes a new directory 'xxx'.
