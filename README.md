# MLGeo-23_linjon 

##Welcome
Jonathan Lindenmann's MLGeo2023 repository. 

This repo will be the foundation for the computational side of my future science projects, possibly exploring such things as: 

- Types of nephrite microstructures
- Formation mechanisms for different nephrites
- Impact assessments for un(der)regulated mining projects
- ML-assisted mineral exploration
- lots more


##Getting started
This repository is stored in the [UW-ESS-DS GitHub](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS) organization and contains a copy of `environment.yml` from the class repository [UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-2023](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-2023)

To access and work on any of my projects, you can fork and clone my repository by following the instructions in the 'HowToContribute.pdf' document. To summarize here, you'll be making a fork of this repo, then putting it all on your own computer using GitHub Desktop or entering the following commands in the command line interface:

1. Fork the repo, giving it a name and making yourself the owner.
2. Open your terminal and navigate your working directory to the location you want to clone the repo to using `cd directory_name` and `ls` commands. Once there, enter:
    `git clone “https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_PAGE/YOUR_NEW_NAME_FOR_MY_REPO”`
    
3. With the forked repo cloned on your computer, you can now work on the files in the directory or add new ones.
4. When you are done, make sure all the changed and added files are inside the repository's directory, and then `add` them all to the staging are for your next commit:
    `git add filename`
Lastly, check that all the files you want to include in the commit are staged:
    `git diff --staged`
5. Make a commit, giving it a clear description:
    `git commit -m "Message"`
6. This commit is now stored locally in your cloned repository. You still need to push it to the remote one on GitHub:
    `git push ""`

## Installation/Deployment

## Basic Usage: step-by-step instructions to use the software

This section covers coding commands and techniques from MLGeo2023 classes. 

For the command line interface (CLI):

mkdir xxx - makes a new directory 'xxx'.
